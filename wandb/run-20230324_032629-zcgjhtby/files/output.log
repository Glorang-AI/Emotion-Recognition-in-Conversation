Some weights of the model checkpoint at kresnik/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-korean were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2Model: ['lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2Model from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2Model from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
